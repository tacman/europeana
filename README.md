## A PHP client library for the Europeana Portal

This PHP library provides a highly abstract client implementation of the [Europeana REST API](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/). It allows your PHP application to query and retrieve the Europeana datasets which are published via the main [Europeana Portal](http://www.europeana.eu/) in a highly abstracted, developer friendly fashion.

### What is Europeana?

Europeana is an internet portal that acts as an interface to books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised throughout Europe. More then 2.000 institutions across Europe have contributed. These range from large names such as the Rijksmuseum, the British Library or the Louvre to regional archives and local museums.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require colada/europeana
```

## Usage

### API Key

You will need an API key before you can connect to the API endpoint. You can register an account an obtain a key at the [Europeana Labs](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/registration/) website.

### Basic example

Perform a basic search query:

```php
$apiKey = "myRegisteredKey";
$payload = new Colada\Europeana\Payload\SearchPayload();
$payload->addQuery("Mona Lisa");

try
{
    $client = new Guzzle\Client()
    $apiClient = new Colada\Europeana\Transport\ApiClient($apiKey, $client);

    $payloadResponse = $apiClient->send($payload);

    $items = $payloadResponse->getItems();
    foreach ($items as $item) {
        $item->getTitle();
        $item->getType();
    }

} catch (new Colada\Europeana\Exception\EuropeanaException $e) {
    // Process the exception
}
```

## Features

- API calls are modelled as a Payload -> Transport -> Response class representation.
- The response is deserialized using the [JMS Serializer](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer) library into first class citizen PHP objects.
- Highly abstracted, loose coupled components for easy reuse in your own applications.

## Documentation

Currently these API calls are entirely of partially implemented:

Action                | API call                            | Status
--------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------
Search                | search.json | Incomplete            |
Record                | record.json | Incomplete            |
Dataset               | dataset/[datasetId].json            | Complete
Provider              | provider/[providerId].json          | Complete
Suggestions           | suggestions.json                    | Complete
